  Hello,
  <p>
    I am a big fan of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com" target="_blank">Hacker News</a> but sometimes I do not
    have time to check it frequently and I created this web page, so I can read daily, weekly, monthly top news
    to stay up to date. If you want to receive daily, weekly, monthly or annually <a
    href="https://www.hntoplinks.com"
    target="_blank">Hacker News Top
    Links</a> emails please subscribe from <a href="/subscribe" target="_blank">here</a>
  </p>

  <p>There are also other alternatives to help Hacker News fans to read it more efficiently. See <a
    href="https://github.com/cheeaun/hackerweb/wiki/Hacker-News-apps" target="_blank">following list</a> for all
    alternative Hacker News reading applications.</p>
